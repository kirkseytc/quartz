In quartz, libraries should contain at least two files:
    1.  a header file ('.qzh') that exposes the function signatures and datatypes.
    2.  a shared object file ('.qzso') that contains the precompiled code 
        for the linker to link to.

The header file is also where you can provide documentation for the function.
