@future: // planned array storage idea

The array datatype that is the backbone for all arrays

it is layout like this:

array
 |- Type (An enum that has the byte size of all datatypes)
 |- Sizes[] (an array of integers that contain the size data of the array)
 |      |- [0] # of dimensions
 |      |- [1] size of dimension 1
 |      |- [...]
 |      |- [n] size of dimension n
 |
 |- Data

In memory: [ TYPE ][ ... SIZE ... ][ ... DATA ... ]

Same as C, '<var_name>[0]' will still be functionally equivalent to '*<var_name>'

to create a C Style array you do:

    #c int <var_name>[] = {0, 1, 2, 4, 8};

array
 |- Type
 |- Sizes[]
 |     |- [0] # of dimensions
 |     |- [n] size of dimension
 |
 |- Data
