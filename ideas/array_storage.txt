@future: // planned array storage idea

The array datatype that is the backbone for all arrays

it is layout like this:

array
 |- Type (An enum that has the byte size of all datatypes)
 |- Sizes[] (an array of integers that contain the size data of the array)
 |      |- [0] # of dimensions
 |      |- [1] size of dimension 1
 |      |- [...]
 |      |- [n] size of dimension n
 |
 |- Data

In memory: [ TYPE ][ ... SIZE ... ][ ... DATA ... ]

Unlike C, '<arrayname>[0]' will not be functionally equivalent to '*<arrayname>'. The syntax '*<arrayname>' will de-reference a pointed to array to perform operations with.
